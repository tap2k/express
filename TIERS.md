## Enforcement Rules

### Soft Warning at 80%
- Banner/notification shown when storage usage reaches 80% of limit
- Upload and channel creation still allowed
- "Upgrade" link displayed

### Hard Block at 110%
- New uploads blocked
- New channel creation blocked
- Existing content remains fully accessible (read-only freeze)
- Persistent upgrade prompt

### Downgrade Behavior
- All existing content is preserved — nothing is deleted
- New uploads and channel creation blocked until usage is under the new limit
- Users can delete content themselves to get under the limit, or re-upgrade
- Over-limit banner shown with upgrade CTA
- *Note: Over-limit content on downgraded accounts is preserved indefinitely. If storage abuse becomes material, add a 90-day retention policy (content archived, not deleted, restorable on re-upgrade).*

---

## Feature Gating Details

### Storage
- Measured as total across all channels owned by the user (recursive, includes children)
- Includes: media files, audio files, overlays, asset bundles, channel pictures
- Enforcement checks the **channel owner's** plan, not the uploading user's (editors upload to someone else's channel)

### Channels
- Count of all channels where user is the owner
- Limit applies to creation only — existing channels are never removed on downgrade

### Per-file Limit
- Checked on each upload, both client-side (UX) and server-side (enforcement)
- Applies to all upload paths: authenticated, privateID, and public submission

### Tileset Picker
- Free users get the default tileset only (no dropdown in map view)
- Starter+ users see the tileset selection dropdown
- Server-side enforcement prevents tileset changes via API for Free users

### Custom Marker Colors
- Free users get default marker colors only (color dropdown hidden in tag editor)
- Starter+ users can set marker colors per tag
- Server-side enforcement strips markercolor changes from tag update requests for Free users
- Existing custom colors remain visible on downgrade — only editing is blocked

### Custom Marker Icons
- Free users cannot upload custom marker icons (thumbnail upload hidden in tag editor)
- Starter+ users can upload custom icon thumbnails per tag
- Server-side enforcement strips thumbnail uploads from tag update requests for Free users
- Existing custom icons remain visible on downgrade — only uploading new ones is blocked

### Map Overlays
- Free users cannot upload overlays (overlay button hidden in map view)
- Starter+ users see the overlay button and can upload/manage overlays
- Server-side enforcement blocks overlay upload requests for Free users
- Existing overlays remain visible on downgrade — only new uploads are blocked

### Collaboration
- Free: view-only access via public links (uniqueID)
- Starter+: can add editors to channels, full owner + editor permission model
- Server-side enforcement prevents adding editors for Free users

### Video Generation
- Boolean gate: Pro and Enterprise only
- Not metered — unlimited use within tier
- Fire-and-forget to external video service, no tracking
- Server-side enforcement via JWT check on makevideo API route

### API Access
- Enterprise only
- Implementation deferred

### SSO
- Enterprise only
- Implementation deferred — listed in pricing table only

---

## Billing

### Payment Provider
- Stripe (Checkout + Customer Portal + Webhooks)

### Pricing (in cents for Stripe)
| Plan | Monthly | Annual (per month) | Annual (total) |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Free | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Starter | 500 | 400 | 4800 |
| Pro | 2000 | 1600 | 19200 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom |

### Stripe Integration Points
- `POST /api/createCheckout` — creates Stripe checkout session for new subscriptions
- `POST /api/createPortal` — opens Stripe customer portal for billing management
- `POST /api/stripeWebhook` — handles Stripe events (subscription changes, payments, cancellations)

### Webhook Events Handled
- `checkout.session.completed` → activate plan
- `customer.subscription.updated` → update plan on change
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → downgrade to Free
- `invoice.payment_failed` → log warning

---

## Data Model

### User Schema (Strapi)
New fields added to `users-permissions` user:
- `plan` — enum: free/starter/pro/enterprise (default: "free")
- `stripeCustomerId` — string (private)
- `stripeSubscriptionId` — string (private)
- `billingInterval` — enum: monthly/annual (default: "monthly")
- `planOverrides` — JSON (Enterprise custom limits, e.g. `{"storageMB": 500000}`)

### Tier Config (Strapi)
Single source of truth at `strapi/config/tiers.js` — defines all limits, prices, and feature flags per tier.

### Client Config (Express)
Tier display data is defined inline in `express/components/pricingtable.js` — human-readable limits and prices for the pricing table UI.

---

## Deployment Modes

### Cloud (Hosted)
The default. Users sign up on the hosted platform, tiers enforced per-user via Stripe billing.

### Self-Hosted (GitHub)
Anyone can clone the repo and run it. **All features are unlocked with no tier enforcement** when Stripe is not configured. Each app checks its own env var:
- **Strapi:** `TIER_ENFORCEMENT` — when unset, `checkTierLimit()` returns null and all server-side limits are skipped
- **Express:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — when unset, the video generation tier check is skipped

**Implementation:** No license keys, no deployment modes. Self-hosters simply don't set these env vars.

### Enterprise (Cloud)
Enterprise is manually managed:
1. Set user's `plan` to "enterprise" via Strapi admin panel
2. Set custom limits via `planOverrides` JSON field (e.g. `{"storageMB": 500000, "maxFileSizeMB": 5000}`)
3. Stripe subscription managed separately or via custom invoicing
4. "Contact Us" flow on marketing page (email link)

### Enterprise (Self-Hosted / On-Prem)
Deferred until first customer requests it. Would use a license key instead of Stripe — the instance runs as Enterprise for all users, no per-user billing. See Key Design Decisions for notes.

## Stripe Setup

### 1. Create a Stripe Account
- Sign up at [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
- Use **Test Mode** during development (toggle in top-right of dashboard)

### 2. Create Products and Prices
In the Stripe Dashboard → Products → Add Product:

**Starter Plan:**
- Name: "Starter"
- Monthly price: $5/month (recurring)
- Annual price: $48/year ($4/month equivalent, recurring)
- Copy both Price IDs (`price_...`) → set as `STRIPE_STARTER_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`

**Pro Plan:**
- Name: "Pro"
- Monthly price: $20/month (recurring)
- Annual price: $192/year ($16/month equivalent, recurring)
- Copy both Price IDs → set as `STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID` and `STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`

### 3. Get API Keys
- Dashboard → Developers → API keys
- Copy the **Secret key** → `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- Copy the **Publishable key** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### 4. Set Up Webhooks
- Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint
- Endpoint URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripeWebhook`
- Events to listen for:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`
- Copy the **Signing secret** (`whsec_...`) → `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 5. Configure Customer Portal
- Dashboard → Settings → Billing → Customer portal
- Enable: subscription cancellation, plan switching, payment method updates
- This powers the `/api/createPortal` endpoint

### 6. Test Cards
Use these in test mode:
- `4242 4242 4242 4242` — successful payment
- `4000 0000 0000 0341` — payment declined
- Any future expiry, any 3-digit CVC, any billing ZIP

### Still TODO (in priority order)
1. **Marketing page: examples** — link to live sample channels/maps users can explore

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. Enforcement checks the **channel owner's** plan, not the uploading user's
2. `calculateChannelSize` returns MB (KB/1024) — tier config uses MB to match
3. Downgrade = read-only freeze, no data deletion
4. Enterprise is manual (Strapi admin + planOverrides JSON)
5. Video generation is boolean (Pro+), not metered
6. Client-side validation is convenience only — server-side is the real gate
7. SSO listed as Enterprise feature, implementation deferred
8. Marketing page replaces logged-out index — no separate /pricing route
9. Sample maps on marketing page reuse existing Mapper component or screenshots + links
10. **Self-hosted = fully unlocked** — no Stripe config means no enforcement, all features available. Standard open-source model.
11. **Enterprise on-prem** deferred — would use license key for support/SLA tracking, but features are already unlocked
